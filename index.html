  <h2>Q&A</h2>
  
  <!-- Question 1 -->
  <div class="question-1">
      <h3>Question 1: List three main differences between Web1, Web2, and Web3.</h3>
      <p>
          <strong>1. Web1:</strong> Web1 is the early static web. Websites in Web1 were composed of static pages with information, with no interaction from the user. It was primarily informational. For example, a website in Web1 might only display a list of side effects of medications without offering any dynamic interaction or real-time information.<br>
          <strong>2. Web2:</strong> Web2 introduced interactivity. It allowed users to not only consume content but also to contribute, share, and create. Examples include social media, blogs, and wikis. In Web2, a search query for "side effects of medications" would provide results from a variety of interactive websites, such as user-generated reviews and forums.<br>
          <strong>3. Web3:</strong> Web3 represents a decentralized web built on blockchain technology. It allows users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps), gives control to users over their data, and facilitates peer-to-peer transactions. In Web3, a search for "side effects of medications" could pull data from decentralized healthcare platforms where users control and verify the information using blockchain technology.
      </p>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Question 2 -->
  <div class="question-2">
      <h3>Question 2: Explain the differences noted in question 1 by giving an example of a use case. For example, searching for the query "side effects of medications" will appear in a certain way in Web1 and in a different way in Web3.</h3>
      <p>
          <strong>Web1 Example:</strong> In Web1, a search for "side effects of medications" would return a basic list of static pages, such as informational websites from pharmaceutical companies or government health websites. The information would be fixed, without the ability to interact with it or get personalized responses.<br>
          <strong>Web2 Example:</strong> In Web2, the search query would return a variety of interactive results, such as articles, reviews, forums, and user-generated content on health websites or social media. Users can leave comments, add their own experiences, or rate the medications.<br>
          <strong>Web3 Example:</strong> In Web3, the search might bring decentralized health platforms where information is verified through blockchain. Users could see peer-reviewed data from people who have used specific medications, and they could potentially contribute their own experiences in a secure and verifiable manner. Blockchain would ensure the authenticity and security of the data shared.
